## System Requirement

The codes have been tested with Python 3.

## Instruction

Run the script "main_cartpole.m" for the cart-pole problem.
Run the script "main_mountaincar.m" for the mountain car problem.
The codes that interface the hardware is not provided. 

The real_array2 backend are dependent on the measurement system and hardware. 
The demo runs a multilayer perceptron Q-network. For construction of other advanced Q-network, please use the framework https://github.com/zhongruiwang/memristorCNN.
The experimental data will be provided upon reasonable request.
